# --- factory_config.yaml ---
# This file contains all relevant configurations for the ExperimentFactory's
# get_model() method. In a real experiment, you would only have one 'model'
# section active.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration for the advanced, dynamic Multi-Task Learning (MTL) model
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
model:
  # This explicit flag tells the factory to build the CoralMTLModel.
  type: "CoralMTL"

  params:
    # Name of the SegFormer backbone from Hugging Face Hub.
    backbone: "nvidia/mit-b2"
    # Unified channel dimension for all decoder streams.
    decoder_channel: 256
    # Dimension for Query, Key, and Value in the cross-attention module.
    attention_dim: 128

  # These lists define the task names for the primary and auxiliary decoders.
  # The factory will look up these names in the task_definitions.yaml file
  # to determine the number of classes for each corresponding decoder head.
  tasks:
    primary: ["genus", "health"]
    auxiliary: ["fish", "human_artifacts", "substrate", "background", "biota"]

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration for Datasets and DataLoaders
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
data:
  # The factory will first check if this is a valid local path. If not, it assumes
  # it's a Hugging Face Hub dataset ID.
  dataset_name: "./dataset/"

  # Path to the pre-processed PDS-sampled training patches.
  # This is prioritized for the 'train' split, as specified in dataset.py.
  pds_train_path: "./dataset/processed/pds_patches/"
  
  # Path to the raw, full-image dataset. Used for 'val' and 'test' splits,
  # and as a fallback for 'train' if pds_train_path is not found.
  data_root_path: "./dataset/"

  # The single source of truth for all class and task information.
  # Required for MTL models and for non-MTL models being evaluated on MTL tasks.
  task_definitions_path: "configs/baseline_comparisons/task_definitions_mtl_no_flattening.yaml"
  
  # Parameters for the final DataLoader object.
  batch_size: 4
  num_workers: 4
  
  # A fundamental parameter shared by datasets and augmentations.
  patch_size: 512

  loss:
  # This type corresponds to the CoralMTLLoss class for our main model.
  type: "CompositeHierarchical"

  params:
    # Optional weight for the logical consistency penalty term.
    w_consistency: 0.1
    # Weight for the primary loss component (Focal/CE) in the hybrid loss.
    # The Dice loss component will have weight (1 - hybrid_alpha).
    hybrid_alpha: 0.5
    # The focusing parameter for the Focal Loss component.
    focal_gamma: 2.0
    # The class index to be ignored during loss calculation.
    ignore_index: 0


metrics:
  # This list is crucial. It tells both metrics calculators which tasks should
  # be used to compute the Boundary IoU (BIoU) and the final H-Mean score.
  # The names must match the task names in task_definitions.yaml.
  primary_tasks: ["genus", "health"]
  
  # The thickness of the band (in pixels) used for BIoU calculation.
  boundary_thickness: 2
  
  # The class index to be ignored during metric calculation.
  # This should be consistent with the ignore_index in the loss function.
  ignore_index: 0

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration for the Trainer Engine
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
trainer:
  # The main device for training. Can be "cuda", "cpu", or "auto".
  device: "cuda"
  
  # Total number of epochs for the training run.
  epochs: 100
  
  # Directory where checkpoints, logs, and other artifacts will be saved.
  output_dir: "experiments/baseline_comparisons/coral_mtl_b2_run"
  
  # Number of steps to accumulate gradients before performing an optimizer step.
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 2
  
  # The key metric from the validation results used for selecting the best model.
  # Should be 'H-Mean' for MTL models or a task-specific 'mIoU_{task_name}' for baselines.
  model_selection_metric: "H-Mean"
  
  # --- Parameters for the SlidingWindowInferrer used during validation ---
  # The step size for the sliding window. A stride of patch_size/2 creates 50% overlap.
  inference_stride: 256
  
  # The number of patches to process in a single batch during validation inference.
  inference_batch_size: 16

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration for the Evaluator Engine
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
evaluator:
  # Optional: Explicitly provide a path to a model checkpoint.
  # If this is commented out or null, the factory will automatically find
  # the 'best_model.pth' file inside the trainer.output_dir.
  checkpoint_path: null

  # Optional: Specify a dedicated directory for evaluation artifacts.
  # If null, it defaults to a subfolder named 'evaluation' within trainer.output_dir.
  output_dir: null
  
  # The number of qualitative result images to generate and save.
