# --- factory_config.yaml ---
# This file contains all relevant configurations for the ExperimentFactory's
# get_model() method. In a real experiment, you would only have one 'model'
# section active.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
model:
  # This explicit flag tells the factory to build the CoralMTLModel.
  type: "CoralMTL"

    # Dimension for Query, Key, and Value in the cross-attention module.
    attention_dim: 128

  # The factory will look up these names in the task_definitions.yaml file
  # to determine the number of classes for each corresponding decoder head.

  # it's a Hugging Face Hub dataset ID.

  # This is prioritized for the 'train' split, as specified in dataset.py.
  pds_train_path: "./dataset/processed/pds_patches/"
